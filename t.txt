I have a wavemaker-rn-mcp, I want to create an proper finetuned Prompt Agent ( where every word counts) on Top of these MCP tools which will use them and answer proeprly for Wavemaker 

here is my general idea of how the prompt should be 
Query -> 
- Check Intent
- Check and Plan What to do
- Check and Make sure we can implement the Plan at every step
- Create a Check list (which will be updated once the a task in the plan is completed successfully)
- Start implement the plan task one by one
- Validate the task execution after evey task
- Update and carry forward the not to the next task
- Check if there are any errors, if there are Errors then check for 3 W ( Why it happend?, When it happend? and What cause it?) 
- Come up with possible solution plan and update the note
- Continue.....

1.Check and tell me best ways to create Prompt based Agents
2. Check and see if the above plan works or not and suggest better plans or improvements

Before you answer these I want you to go through /Users/raajr_500278/ai/wavemaker-rn-mcp and create your own understanding and let me know if you have any doubts.
and also see if can take advantage of tool description as prompts as they are very detailed
